# Forum/Proposals/Snapshot

**First**, any community member can make a proposal \(**CIP**\) \(**C**over Protocol **I**mprovement **P**lan\) by creating a new topic on [`forum.coverprotocol.com`](https://forum.coverprotocol.com/c/proposals-cips), following the format [here](https://forum.coverprotocol.com/t/proposal-cip-outline/71). The proposal will be discussed and voted on prior to being uploaded to Snapshot.

**Second**, if the proposal has gained enough traction and has positive sentiment, the proposal creator can contact a team member to have it added to [`snapshot.page`](https://vote.coverprotocol.com/#/) as a core proposal. Community members can also add it themselves if they have 10 or more $COVER tokens.

**Third**, after the snapshot vote has concluded, the team will wait 48 hours before executing the decision.
