# xCOVER

With this [_passed proposal_](https://vote.coverprotocol.com/#/cover-protocol.eth/proposal/QmXw7bjEUJHaQyQwSnLknWhhFC7XfpwckMh4cVTLB4QAgP) by the community, COVER holders can now stake their COVER to receive xCOVER.

There is **no fees** charged for xCOVER except the gas you pay.

### What is the benefit?

With xCOVER, you will be able to

* vote on Cover Protocol proposals on snapshot. With the [_xcover strategy_](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot.js/pull/137/files) __merged, you will be able to vote on [_Cover Snapshot Space proposals_](https://vote.coverprotocol.com/) with xCOVER.
* share platform revenue. Currently 30% of the platform fees are used to buy back COVER and distribute those COVER to xCOVER holders.
* borrow against xCOVER on various lending platforms including [_Ruler Protocol_](https://app.rulerprotocol.com/app/markets) soon.

### When does the buy back happen?

There is no set schedule in terms of when does the buy back happen. However, the team will execute the buy back as least **once a week** unless newly generated fees is less than $1000 during the week. **More buy backs** will be executed as necessary \(like around coverage expiry\) if significant more fees are generated.
