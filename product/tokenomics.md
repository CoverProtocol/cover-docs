For every year after the first, there will be an additional 10,000 COVER minted that halves every year after. With 90% of the total amount allocated to shield mining and 10% to the treasury.![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/27/0*lKgL6Gs6jAWeybd7?q=20)

## Notes on governance for tokenomics <a id="8702"></a>

After 6 months, inflation for shield mining can be revisited and adjusted to meet the needs/demands of the protocol by the community.

We are creating a **revolutionary product** that will have a lasting impact on DeFi and the crypto community. The new tokenomics are designed to ensure the **future success** of the protocol while also keeping **early supporters** in mind. Expect more news to come soon. We count on your continuous support as COVER moves forward.
