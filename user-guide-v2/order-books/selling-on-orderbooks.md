# Selling Coverage - Order Book

**The website to access the order books is located here:** [**https://coverrules.com/**](https://coverrules.com/)\*\*\*\*

{% hint style="info" %}
Selling on the order book allows you to set the amount of coverage you would sell, at the rate you want. Place the sell order and let it get filled. This can be done with CLAIM and NOCLAIM tokens.

{% hint style="success" %}
When selling on the order books, the seller only pays gas if canceling an order! The buyer pays the gas for taking an order!
