# Redeeming

**You can redeem your collateral or claim payouts in the following ways:**

1. There is no claim is accepted by expiration, you return your NOCLAIM token back and retrieve your collateral. \(note: there is a 10 day delay\)
2. A claim is accepted, you return your CLAIM token back and retrieve your claim payout. \(note: the claims process can take up to 10 days\) 
3. A claim is accepted but there is a partial payout \(see: [Partial Payout](partial-payouts-described.md)\), you would use a combination of NOCLAIM and CLAIM tokens. 
4. Unwrapping, you use equal amounts of NOCLAIM+CLAIM tokens to retrieve your collateral back \(this can only be done prior to an expiration, see: [unwrap](unwrap.md)\)
