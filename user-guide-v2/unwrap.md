# Unwrap

### Unwrapping allows you to return CLAIM + NOCLAIM tokens. By doing this you can get your collateral back without waiting for the expiration redemption/selling. 

**Example:** 

* **You minted 100 CLAIM tokens and 100 NOCLAIM tokens for Badger coverage using 100 DAI.** 
  * **You must return those 100 CLAIM tokens and 100 NOCLAIM tokens to get your 100 DAI back.**
    * **If you have 100 CLAIM tokens and 99 NOCLAIM tokens you will only get 99 DAI back on the unwrap**
    * **If you have 99 CLAIM tokens and 100 NOCLAIM tokens you will only get 99 DAI back on the unwrap**
