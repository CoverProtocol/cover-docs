# Overview

Cover is implementing a new user experience for our users. There are no fundamental changes on the product, but the new experience will make it easy for our three groups of users:

* Coverage seekers, hold CLAIM tokens only
* Coverage providers, hold NOCLAIM tokens only
* Market Makers, hold both CLAIM and NOCLAIM tokens

Once implementation completes, an announcement will be made.
