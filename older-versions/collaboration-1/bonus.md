# Sponsor a Reward Program

You can sponsor any covToken DEX pools with a bonus token. By sponsoring a reward program, you encourage market makers and coverage providers to provide liquidity for coverages of your protocol. The bonus tokens for your protocol's rewards program \([_**BonusRewards**_](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8FC8551dd5E2Dc5d2B04f2957E543D7d53a79f1e#readContract) _****_contract\) will be distributed to LPs of the trading pools linearly until expiration.

* The bonus program can start anytime
* The program should end no later than the expiry of the coverage

Contact the Cover team to add a bonus program for you. Once agreed,  please send the bonus tokens for the coverage to our dev multi-sig: **0x15957f0CA310d35b2E73fB5070Ce44A5B0141AB1**.
